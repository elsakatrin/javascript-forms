# javascript-forms

I made this form in the accessibility guide so it's reused with small changes
Even though it's reused I felt like I didn't have a lot of time doing this guide because of struggles with javascript.

I would have liked to make the contact form look better and be prettier but I ran out of time - didn't want to get behind on the guides and I focused on making the javascript work. 
I know I could have made it better with a little more time so sorry for that - we all like to look at pretty and visually pleasing websites :)

I commented everything into the code, index.html, styles.css and main.js


I made a simple contact form with a modal window for a success screen. 
When you leave required fields empty you get an alert that says what's missing. Also if you write an unvalid email. 
There are icons that appear on the right side of the input fields, either success or failure

I think I spent a lot of time trying to make things work in JavaScript so I didn't get to make it as fun as I wanted. 

There are some issues with the code, for example when you try to push send with an empty required field the red failure icon appears but after you fill it out the green success icon just appears beside it - cant figure out why so if you have the knowledge what I could do or why it's happening it would be great! :D (I kind of know why it's happening but cant figure out how to fix it)
